```js
function goto(level,button){
  const possbileLevels = [0,1,2,3];
  const possbileButtons = ["0","1","2","3"];

  if (possbileLevels.indexOf(level) <0) return 0;
  if (possbileButtons.indexOf(button) <0) return 0;

  return parseInt(button) - level;
}
```

### Strategy Analysis

Compare the arguments exhaustively to the possible valid arguments. 
If they don't exist in the valid arrays, return 0. Otherwise return the subtraction.

___

### Language Features

* Single line if statement
* indexOf: Array prototype method
  * Args: 1 (2, but one we care about)
    * Any type: the item to search for
  * Return: Number
    * The index of the first instance of your search query
    * Or -1 if it doesn't exist
  * Behavior: searches for the item. if it's there, it returns the index for the first instance. otherwise -1

### Comparison

They used the same strategy we did, but their implementation is even cleaner than ours. They very cleverly used built-in language features to make their code more succinct and readable.
